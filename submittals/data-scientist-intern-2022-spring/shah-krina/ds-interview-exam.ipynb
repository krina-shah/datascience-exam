    "1. To Find a \"good\" subset of features that show strong univariate correlation with class labels we need to find the correlation between the features. There are two types pearson and spearman. As we are not sure about the underlying distribution of the data we can use spearman correlation and it measure the monotonic relationship whether the variavle tends to move in same direction or opposite. Here the rate is not constant while in pearson it determine linearilty of the relationship at constant rate. Thus, We can find \"good\" subset of features that show strong univariate correlation with class labels using spearman correlaion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data splitting can be done using Kfold cross validation. We can build multi class classifier my using various classification algorithm likes random forest, K Nearest Neighbour, Gradient Boosting. We can use different hyperparameters tuning parameters for random forest such as number of nodes, number of trees generation, depth of the tree, number of features,  min number of data points placed in a node before the node is split, min number of data points allowed in a leaf node. We can estimate the performace of different classifier by evaluation performance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Generalization error can be measured by MSE(Mean Square Error). Generalization error consist of bais, variance and noise. In machine learning model there is a bais variance trade off. Whenever we try to train our model, we want our model that does not have high variance or bais. But if we try to decrease bais/variance the other oncreases and vice versa.Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict.Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value which tells us spread of our data. Generally, if the training model has less parameters then changes of high of having high bais and low variance; while if model have large number of paramater that it might have high variance and low bais. Thus high bais will lead to iversimplification while high variance will lead to complex model."
